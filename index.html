                I hold the James and Mary Wesley Chair in New Media at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I have been a professor since 1991. I am also teach occasionally in the Computer Science and Media Technology section at Malmö University in Sweden. I work internationally in the design of New Media educational programs and research initiatives for digital media. 
                In my research, I study the history and current state of our media culture; I also work with Maria Engberg and Blair MacIntyre to create new media experiences (in Augmented  and Mixed Reality). I teach in the GT graduate program in Digital Media and the undergraduate program in Computational Media.

                I am frequently invited to lecture in Europe and North America. My two most recent books, both from MIT Press, are: 

                The Digital Plenitude: The Decline of Elite Culture and the Rise of New Media (2019). There is a digital companion at www.digitalplenitude.net.
                
                Reality Media: Augmented and Virtual Reality (2021)
                This book is coauthored with Maria Engberg and Blair MacIntyre. We are currently developing an extensive digital version in web-based XR at realitymedia.digital.

          My research includes both theory and practice: studying the cultural significance of digital media and designing and experimenting with new media forms. On the practical level, I have worked with computer scientists and designers in the Augmented Environments Lab at Georgia Tech to create new digital experiences and media forms. On the theoretical and historical side, I study today's heterogenous media culture and its relationship to the twentieth-century media forms and practices.  My two current areas of focus: 
        
          <h4>Extended Reality Experience Design</h4>
          For more than two decade, I worked with Prof. Blair MacIntyre who heads the AEL (Augmented Environments Lab) to explore new forms of informal education, personal expression, and entertainment. We designed an built a number of protoypes and experimental systems for Augmented Reality. More recently we created experiences in VR, and specially WebVR, a protocol that allows users to access VR through a web browser on a smartphone, computer, or through a VR headset. We created a companion to our book Reality Media (MIT Press, 2021) using this technology. Now the AEL is experimenting not only with "true" 3D VR, but also with cinematic VR (CVR) or 360 video. Ph.D. students in our lab are also exploring the aesthetics of generative AI, especially for the creative of traditional screen-based cinema and potentially CVR.

          <h4>(Digital) Media Theory and History</h4>
            I also how new (digital) media affect and are affected by earlier media and media forms, including film, television, and print. That work began with <i>Writing Space: The Computer, Hypertext and the Remediation of Print</i> (first edition 1991; second edition 2001 by Lawrence Erlbaum). Writing Space examined the computer’s place in the history of symbolic (textual) media. In the second edition, I argue that digital hypertext is the remediation of the printed book.
          Published between the first and second editions of Writing Space, Remediation: Understanding New Media (coauthored by Richard Grusin, MIT Press, 1999) focuses on the relationship between visual digital expressions (such as computer games and the World Wide Web) and earlier media forms (such as film and television). We argue that digital forms both borrow from and seek to surpass earlier forms, and we give this process the name “remediation.” Windows and Mirrors (coauthored with Diane Gromala, MIT Press, 2003) argues that digital art is a radical form of interface design. Interfaces reflect the dichotomy, discussed in Remediation, between the aesthetics of immediacy and hypermediacy. The Digital Plenitude was published by MIT Press in 2019. The book focuses on two developments in the second half of the twentieth century have that helped to define our media culture in the twenty-first: the decline of cultural hierarchy and the rise of digital media: ​ 
          
          In addition I have authored or coauthored numerous papers on digital media, see my cv for a complete list.

                I teach courses in media theory and practice in the programs in Computational Media (B.S.) and Digital Media (Ph.D.) here at Georgia Tech In the Digital Media program.

                Courses that I teach regularly include:
                     1. Digital media history and theory (LCC 8000 and LCC 8001)
                      2.  Augmented Reality experience design (LCC 6340, which I co-teach as a computer science course with my collaborator Blair MacIntyre)

      Here is a short bio:  

      Jay David Bolter is Wesley Chair of New Media at the Georgia Institute of Technology and co-Director of the Augmented Environments Lab (AEL) there.  He is the author of  Turing's Man:  Western Culture in the  Computer Age (1984);  Writing Space: The Computer, Hypertext, and  the History of Writing,  (1991; second edition 2001); Remediation (1999), with Richard Grusin; and Windows and Mirrors (2003), with Diane Gromala. 
      
      In addition to writing about new media, Bolter collaborates in the construction of new digital media forms. With Michael Joyce, he created Storyspace, one of the early hypertext authoring system. Now, with the AEL collaborators at Georgia Tech including Profs Blair MacIntyre and Maria Engberg, Bolter helps to create on applications for entertainment, education, and cultural heritage. The platform for these applications is the AEL's Argon browser for smart phones and table
